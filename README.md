Homework for Module 11 - Web Scrapping

Durting this assignment I will scrape a website with articles about the planet Mars and then scrape data from a webpage with data about Mars such as the months, temperature, ls, sol, pressure, etc. With this data I will gather how certain data points are represented in certain months and how some of these data points compare to planet Earth.
